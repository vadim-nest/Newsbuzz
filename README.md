# #newsBuzz

#newsBuzz is a program that collects articles from popular news websites and turns them into hashtags. These hashtags are then stored in a SQL database and displayed on an interactive map, allowing users to see what news is trending in the UK.

To use the program, simply launch it and allow it to collect articles from the specified news websites. Once it has gathered a sufficient amount of data, the hashtags will be generated and stored in the SQL database. The hashtags can then be displayed on the map for users to view.

Users can zoom in and out of the map to see more or less detail, and can click on individual hashtags to see the corresponding articles. This allows users to quickly and easily stay up-to-date with the latest news from the UK.
