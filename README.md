# #newsBuzz

#newsBuzz is a program that collects articles from popular news websites and turns them into hashtags. These hashtags are then stored in a SQL database and displayed on an interactive map, allowing users to see what news is trending in the UK.

Users can zoom in and out of the map to see more or less detail, and can click on individual hashtags to see the corresponding articles. This allows users to quickly and easily stay up-to-date with the latest news from the UK.
